# Project Brief: URL Redirector

## Project Goal
Develop a tool to manage and execute URL redirections based on short-form acronyms.

## Core Requirements
- Redirect short URLs (e.g., `/to/acronym`) to predefined destination URLs.
- Provide a web-based interface for adding, editing, and deleting redirection shortcuts.
- Store redirection mappings persistently.

## Target Users
- Individuals or teams needing to create and manage easy-to-remember shortcuts for long URLs.

## Scope
- Initial phase: Basic redirection functionality and a simple web interface for management.
- Future phases (potential): User authentication, import/export of shortcuts, analytics.
