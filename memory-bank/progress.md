# Progress: URL Redirector

## What Works
- The URL Redirector application is running successfully.
- API tests have been updated and are functioning correctly.
- The README file has been created to provide project documentation.
- The application now redirects from `localhost/gg` without the '/to/' prefix.

## What's Left to Build
- Implement the web interface for managing URL redirections.
- Ensure persistent storage for URL mappings beyond the initial JSON file.

## Current Status
- The application is in a stable state with core functionalities operational.
- Ongoing development will focus on enhancing the user interface and storage solutions.

## Known Issues
- Need to address the persistence of URL mappings for future scalability.

## Recent Changes
- Updated the README to include additional configuration for the local hosts file, noting that this would need to be done in DNS for wider usability.
