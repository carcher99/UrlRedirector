# Progress: URL Redirector

## Recent Changes
- Updated the event listener for the save button to use the `once` option, ensuring it is only called once per click.
- Added logging to the `GET` request handler to track incoming requests for redirects.
- Sorted the existing redirects table by acronym alphabetically in the frontend display.

## Next Steps
- Test the application to ensure that the redirect functionality works as expected and that the count is updated correctly.
- Verify that the API endpoints return the correct data structure and that the frontend displays the data properly.

This documentation reflects the current state of the project and the changes made to improve the redirect functionality.
