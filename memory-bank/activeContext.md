# Active Context: URL Redirector

## Current Work Focus
Setting up the basic project structure and initial server and frontend files.

## Recent Changes
- Created all core memory bank files.
- Created `package.json` and installed dependencies.
- Created `server.js` with basic server setup, redirection logic, and API endpoints.
- Created the `public` directory and initial frontend files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`).

## Next Steps
1. Update `progress.md` to reflect the current status.
2. Start the server.
3. Instruct the user on how to access the configuration page and test the redirection.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using Express.js for the backend due to its simplicity and widespread use.
- Using a simple file-based storage for redirection mappings in the initial phase.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Need to ensure persistent storage for the URL mappings.
