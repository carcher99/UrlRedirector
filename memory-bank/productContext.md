# Product Context: URL Redirector

## Problem Solved
This tool addresses the inconvenience of using long and complex URLs by providing a simple way to create and manage short, memorable redirects.

## How it Should Work
Users should be able to access a web interface to define acronyms and their corresponding destination URLs. When a user navigates to the short URL (e.g., `/to/my-shortcut`), the application should redirect them to the specified destination URL.

## User Experience Goals
- The web interface should be intuitive and easy to use for adding, editing, and deleting shortcuts.
- Redirections should be fast and seamless for the end-user.
- The tool should be reliable and available.
